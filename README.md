DSA practice in Java

This repository contains my daily practice problems in Java for mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I’m building this repo step by step — arrays, strings, recursion, and more — while tracking my progress with clear explanations, brute force & optimized solutions, and edge cases.

---

## 📌 Progress

| Day | Topic  | Problems Solved |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| 1   | Arrays | Max/Min variations (Brute + Optimized), Reverse Array (Brute + Optimized) |

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen Core Java + DSA fundamentals  
- Practice with brute force → optimized approach  
- Track consistency with daily commits  
- Build a portfolio of solved problems for interviews  

---

## ⚡ Approach
- Start with brute force, then improve to optimized  
- Always mention Time & Space Complexity  
- Cover edge cases in test runs  

---

💡 *One problem a day is enough to build consistency.*
