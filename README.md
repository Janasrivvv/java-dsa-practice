DSA practice in Java

This repository contains my daily practice problems in Java for mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Iâ€™m building this repo step by step â€” arrays, strings, recursion, and more â€” while tracking my progress with clear explanations, brute force & optimized solutions, and edge cases.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Strengthen Core Java + DSA fundamentals  
- Practice with brute force â†’ optimized approach  
- Track consistency with daily commits  
- Build a portfolio of solved problems for interviews  

---

## âš¡ Approach
- Start with brute force, then improve to optimized  
- Always mention Time & Space Complexity  
- Cover edge cases in test runs  

---

ðŸ’¡ *One problem a day is enough to build consistency.*
