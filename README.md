## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
java-dsa-practice/
│
├── Arrays/
│   ├── Day1/
│   │   ├── MaxElement.java
│   │   ├── MinElement.java
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── Day2/
│   └── ...
│
├── Strings/
│   ├── Day1/
│   └── ...

## 🧠 Learning Approach

I follow a structured approach to problem-solving:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify the underlying pattern (e.g., sliding window, two pointers).
2. **Brute Force Solution**: Implement a straightforward solution to understand the problem.
3. **Optimization**: Refine the solution to improve time and space complexities.
4. **Documentation**: Record the problem, pattern, approach, and complexities in the README.md.
